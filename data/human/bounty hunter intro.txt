            `   You are wandering around Foundry's capital city when you come across a building marked "Bounty Hunters' Guild." You see a bulletin board with wanted posters with pictures of pirates on them and generous rewards described below for those who capture or kill them. A small crowd has gathered around this board.`

            `   "I had a run-in with Stalgren once," says a tough-looking man wearing bulletproof armor. "He disabled my ship and killed half my crew."`

"You got the guts to be a bounty hunter? If you kill this man, you get free admission into the Guild and a pretty sweet payment at the same time, if you can get him. He's the most slippery criminal in the Core, and he's killed many of us."`
            choice
                `   "Sure, I'll kill him."`

            `   "Good luck, kid. And remember: many of us have tried and failed to kill that man. So don't be ashamed if you can't take him down."`
